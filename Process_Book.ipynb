      "Inspired by the recent influx of news coverage of Ebola in the United States, we decided to investigate and conduct further research about Ebola in West Africa. Prior to this class, we all had interests in global health issues, and we thought this would be an incredible topic to explore that not only corresponds with our passions, but also would be relevant long after our project\u2019s conclusion. We noticed that the current fight against Ebola has been largely ineffective and disorganized, so we thought this may be due to a lack of understanding on how to best distribute the resources. We are hoping to parse through the data in a clear and methodical way that will help us figure out key factors that can prevent the spread of Ebola in the future. \n"
