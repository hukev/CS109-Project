Installation
------------

To clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/haeunchang/CS109-Project.git
```

Organization 
------------

Upload ipython notebooks and cleaned datasets here. Organization to be more organized later.

Julie: Please use the CSV files, and only use the ipython notebooks if you're confused about how I got the data. I'm writing the CSV files from updated DataFrames to my local machine and then adding it to git. If you know a better way, lmk.
